# Basic-Planner-App

A simple desktop planner application built with **Python** and **Tkinter**. This app allows you to manage your tasks and events with due dates, save them to a file, and mark them as complete, intended for organisation.

## Features

  - **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks or events with a title and a due date.
  - **Due Date Picker**: A simple calendar pop-up makes it easy to select due dates.
  - **Mark as Complete**: Toggle a task's status between done and not done, with completed tasks visually marked.
  - **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks you no longer need.
  - **Persistent Storage**: All your tasks are automatically saved to a local file (`planner.txt`), so they're there the next time you open the app.
  - **Automatic Sorting**: Tasks are sorted by their due date, with completed tasks moved to the bottom of the list.
  - **Dark Mode**: A clean, dark interface.
